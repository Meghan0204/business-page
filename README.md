## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – for page structure and content  
- **CSS3** – for styling and layout

## How It Works

- **`index.html`** is the main landing page with business header and content  
- **Additional HTML files** serve as supporting pages or samples  
- **Stylesheets** (e.g., `styles.css`, `samplestyles.css`) define the design  
- **Images** are stored in the `images/` folder and referenced in the HTML

This project is a good example of a static website built with HTML and CSS — foundational skills for responsive web development. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
