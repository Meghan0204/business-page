        <p>At ABC Landscaping, we pride ourselves on being family owned and operated for over 35 years. 
          <br><br><br>
          As a child, I watched my mother and father install beautiful custom landscaping. I regularly was “put to work” on some of my father’s landscaping projects since the time I was four years old. I have always enjoyed the creative portion of landscaping, as well as the satisfaction of making clients elated with their outdoor living space. 
          <br><br><br>
          As I grew, I learned more and more about our family’s business and the creative artistry involved. My interest and passion for this field continued into my college years; where I earned a Bachelor’s of Science degree in Environmental Horticulture with an concentration in  Landscape Design. Shortly after graduating from Colorado State University, I married my “college sweet heart”. Together, we moved from Fort Collins to Colorado Springs to begin the process of taking over the family business from my parents. Within the course of five years, my parents stepped into retirement as I stepped up and into the position that had been created through their legacy. I carry a profound sense of pride, honor, and humility as I now own and operate ABC Landscaping.
